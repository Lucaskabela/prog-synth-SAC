# prog-synth-SAC

**Lucas Kabela**

_A research project investigating applications of Actor Critic in Neural Program Synthesis_

[Proposal](./writeups/project_proposal_final_program_synthesis.pdf)

## References:
This project is largely following the work of Robustfill by [Delvin et al. 17](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07469)

DSL and base code was largerly derived from [here](https://github.com/yeoedward/Robust-Fill/)


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
The following base packages were used to run this repository: 

 - [Python](https://www.python.org/) - 3.6+
 - [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) - 0.15.4+
 - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - 1.16.4+
 - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Lastest (1.2.0+)

### First Steps
This repository contains code for running repeatable experiments with a tool for neural symbolic synthesis of x86 programs.
